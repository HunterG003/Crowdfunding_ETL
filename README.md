# Crowdfunding ETL Project

A group project to build an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and PostgreSQL for extracting, transforming, and loading crowdfunding data from Excel files into a relational database.

In this project, we practiced building an ETL pipeline to process crowdfunding data from Excel files. We extracted and transformed the data, created four CSV files, and then used the CSV files to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema using quick DBD. Finally the created CSV files were used to create a dataframe using regex, giving us a contact list with user id, first name, last name and email.
